# SECURITY POLICY

## Overview

The security of Seatek_Analysis is a top priority. This project processes potentially sensitive environmental data, so we encourage all users and contributors to help keep it safe and secure.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability or suspect a potential issue:

- **Do not open a public issue.**
- Please email [AbhiMhrtr@pm.me] or use [GitHub’s private security advisories](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/repository-advisories/about-repository-security-advisories).
- Provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the issue.
- We aim to respond within 5 business days.

## Supported Versions

| Version  | Supported     |
|----------|--------------|
| `main`   | :white_check_mark: |
| Others   | :x:          |

Only the latest version (`main` branch) receives security updates.

## Dependency Management

- Python dependencies are managed via `requirements.txt`. Keep packages updated with `pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt`.
- R dependencies should be updated regularly with `update.packages()`.
- Use tools like [`pip-audit`](https://pypi.org/project/pip-audit/) (Python) and [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) (R) to check for known vulnerabilities.

## Safe Coding Practices

- **Never commit sensitive info:** Avoid hardcoding API keys, credentials, or personal data. Use [environment variables](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.environ) or secret management tools.
- **Validate data inputs:** Ensure all sensor and environmental data are validated before processing.
- **Follow language-specific security guidelines:**

  - [R Security Best Practices](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Security.html)

## GitHub Security Features

This repository uses:
- [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/keeping-your-dependencies-updated-automatically) for automated dependency updates.
- [Code scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning) for vulnerability detection.

## Contributing Securely

- Review your code for security issues before submitting a pull request.
- Flag any potential security concerns in your PR description.
- Adhere to [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) (Python) and [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) (R) for clarity and maintainability.
