## 2025-05-06 - Optimize file discovery with os.walk and early pruning

**Learning:** Using `pathlib.Path.rglob()` searches the entire tree before allowing filtering. If massive ignored directories (like `node_modules` or `.git`) exist, Python wastes significant CPU and I/O time traversing them.
**Action:** Use `os.walk(topdown=True)` and prune the `dirs` list in place (`dirs[:] = [d for d in dirs if d not in IGNORED_DIRS]`) to prevent traversing ignored trees entirely. Also, `str.endswith(('.ext1', '.ext2'))` is faster than `fnmatch`.
## 2025-05-06 - Optimize os.path.relpath with pathlib.Path\n**Learning:** Using `pathlib.Path(dir, file)` is significantly faster and more readable than redundant combinations of `os.path.join()`, `os.path.relpath()`, and division operators when constructing relative paths from `os.walk()`.\n**Action:** Use `pathlib.Path()` direct construction instead of manual standard library path manipulation.
## 2025-05-06 - Optimize string processing in parsing loops
**Learning:** Calling object-allocating methods like `.strip()`, `.lstrip()`, or `.lower()` on every line in a large file scanning loop introduces significant memory and CPU overhead.
**Action:** Use a fast-fail substring check (`if "pattern" in line:`) before executing the more expensive operations. This short-circuits the condition for lines that don't match, often yielding ~10x faster execution for non-matching lines. Remember to combine conditions with `and` on the same line to avoid increasing nested code complexity.
## 2025-05-06 - Remove unused dependencies to reduce memory overhead and load times in R scripts
**Learning:** Checking for unused heavy dependencies like `dplyr` and `tidyr` is important for reducing memory overhead and load times in R scripts optimized with `data.table` and `openxlsx`.
**Action:** In memory-constrained or performance-critical environments, review required packages and remove those that are not explicitly utilized, avoiding unnecessary dependency installation and import overhead.
